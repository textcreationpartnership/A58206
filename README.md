1. AN Antidote against Anabaptisme:
OR,
Animadversions on that part of the liberty of Prophecying,
which sect. 18. pag. 223. beareth this Title,
A particular Consideration of the opinion
of the ANABAPTISTS:
—It is requisite that the persons baptized should be capable of

Spirit.]Page 229.Concerning a Character or impress Since therefore (say you) the reason of this parity does wholly fail, there is nothing left to inferAnd then also females must not be baptized, because they
were not circumcised.]We answer, 1. As we hYou say —Therefore as Infants were circumcised, so spirituall
Infants shall be baptized &c.]This youAnd this seems to have been the sense of the primitive Church,

of arguing, that Augustine, whose deAnd as ill successe will they have with their other Arguments
as with this]Pag. 229. Num. 14.And whaFrom the action of Christs blessing Infants, to inferre that
they are to be baptized, proves nothingThe conclusion would be with more probability derived thus:
Christ blessed children and so dismissed—As we are sure that God hath not commanded Infants to be
baptized].Page 230. Num. 15.True, God hathQuid ego festinat innocens aetas ad remissionem peccatorum,
was the question of Tertullian (lib. de What need all this stirre? As infants without their own consent,
without any act of their own, and wAnd it is (you say) too narrow a conception of God Almighty

reasonable soul to himself.]We answer: The aBut (you say) nothing is more unreasonable, then because he

as of others, &c.]Page 231. Num. 17.H—God (you say) will by his own immediate mercy bring them

of Origen; for from him Augustine haThere was no command of Scripture to oblige children to the
susception of it.]No command to childrenThe necessity of pedobaptism was not determined in the
Church till in the eighth age after Christ; bI grant (you say) it was practised in Africa before that
time, and they or some of them thought well—Nor at all in other places; we have the testimony of a
learned Pedobaptist Ludovicus Vives, who in But (you say) besides that the tradition cannot be proved to
